# UnityPackageImporter

A [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader) mod for [Resonite VR](https://Resonite.com/) that facilitates the import of Unity Packages.

## Installation
1. Install [ResoniteModLoader](https://github.com/resonite-modding-group/ResoniteModLoader).
2. Place [UnityPackageImporter.dll](https://github.com/dfgHiatus/ResoniteUnityPackagesImporter/releases/latest/download/UnityPackageImporter.dll) into your `rml_mods` folder. This folder should be at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Resonite\rml_mods` for a default install. You can create it if it's missing, or if you launch the game once with ResoniteModLoader installed it will create the folder for you.
3. Do the same for any other files on the release page.
4. Start the game. If you want to verify that the mod is working you can check your Resonite logs.
